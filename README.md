# Data science portfolio by Gim Seng Ng

This is a collection of data science project notebooks I created to learn and explore machine learning algorithms.

## End-to-end projects

### Gameplay Data Analysis

Oftentimes, an end-to-end project is both a fun and challenging experience. I decided to pick something that I have enjoyed with questions I sometimes wondered. I enjoy playing video games in my free time and I often use the website [howlongtobeat.com ](https://www.howlongtobeat.com) to track my backlogs, I decided to build a data science project using gameplay data. The motivation comes from trying to understand gamer's playing behavior and leverage such data to provide guidance for game developer and publisher. Building a predictiv model based on playtime, ratings and sales is a useful tool for gaming industry to balance between profit and establishing satisfactory customer base.

All of the above, and hopefull more, will be explored and answered in the link to the project's github [repo](https://github.com/gimseng/game_stats). The project covers data acquisition (through web-scaping), data exploration and cleaning, data transformation, machine learning model selection and evaluation, and finally building visualization for business analytics and insights.
